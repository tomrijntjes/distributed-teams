# Open Guide to Managing Distributed Teams

A curated list of free and open source resources for managing distributed teams.

## Playbooks

- [Bootstrapping Engineering Standards](https://tomrijntjes.github.io/04-bootstrap-engineering-standards.html) is a playbook for setting engineering standards that are hard to retrofit to an existing team. (disclaimer: my own writing)
- [Managing Distributed Teams](https://tomrijntjes.github.io/03-distributed-teams-tenet.html) is about the key differences between building a colocated team versus a distributed team. (disclaimer: my own writing)

## Project Management

- [Kanban for distributed teams](https://www.nimblework.com/blog/kanban-for-remote-work-teams/) is a workflow that reduces overhead at the cost of predictability
- [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/docs/getting-started/openproject-introduction/) is a project management tool that supports distributed software teams.

## Documentation

Strong documentation processes are extra important in distributed teams to make onboarding smoother and improve institutional learning.

- [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) enable asynchronous collaboration on decisions that are expensive to revert
- [Locality of Reference Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference) is a documentation guideline that emphasizes code comments over readmes and readmes over wikis.
- [Blameless Post Mortem Templates](https://github.com/dastergon/postmortem-templates) improve institutional learning about operational challenges
- [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) enables versioned, hosted documentation.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) allow you to automatically generate changelogs based of commits messages.

## Collaboration
